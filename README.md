Not here to impress. Just writing it down.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

Call it *software engineer*, call it *just messing around with code*.  
I try things, break them, sometimes fix them.  
Security is always on my mind.  
When boredom hits, I build Telegram bots or experiment with web projects.

## ⚡ What I Work With  

- **Python** → the language I trust the most  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** → fine for what they do  
- **C++** → sometimes, when needed  

Databases, caching with Redis, deployment with Docker, build tools like Vite…  
I’ve worked with many tools, but I don’t tie myself to any of them.

## 🤖 AI & Expectations  

I used to think AI was something close to magic —  
a system that *really learns*, something almost alive.  
But the deeper I went, the more it looked like equations stacked on top of each other.  
Powerful, yes. Impressive, sure.  
But not a miracle. Just another piece of human math pretending to be something else.

## 🌑 Thoughts on Sharing  

It’s strange how silence can be louder than noise.  
Sometimes even the simplest gesture of appreciation never comes,  
even when the work speaks for itself.  
That’s when you stop expecting and just keep moving.

## 🎭 Closing  

I’m not chasing titles, labels, or hype.  
I’d rather let my work exist quietly than try to sell myself.  

At the end of the day, I keep building, breaking, and rebuilding.  
That’s the loop.
